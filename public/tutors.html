                                    actually disliked both of those subjects. Hence, she hopes to help other students
                                    discover a passion for STEM, or at the very least make what might now be an
                                    unpleasant subject, one that they can be confident in and enjoy.
                                    Jasmine loves to participate in science fairs, and is currently working on a biochar
                                    water remediation project. She has experience tutoring high school students in the
                                    Khan Academy U.S. math curriculum, and has earned tutoring certificates in units
                                    from algebra 1 to AP calculus. She looks forward to helping students find success in
